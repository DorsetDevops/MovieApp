Report
Since I have some experience working with tree-based layouts, I didn't have much trouble during this project.
The only failed attempts were to implement it using Firebase because mixed up both assessments.
I also had a layout bug with the text overflowing under the NavBar because I didn't use the inner padding.
I used navigation-compose from androidx as it is recommended by the Android team for navigation.
I was inspired by the UI of the website provided in the assessment description.
I used coil-compose to draw the images.

Note: I couldn't install the APK from the build as I'm running out of time and I couldn't find it in the emulator, but i'll check and update tomorrow or this weekend.
